# 🔥 Fire Alarm System using Arduino | TinkerCAD Simulation

This project simulates a simple **Fire Alarm System** using **Arduino**, a **temperature sensor**, and a **gas sensor** in **TinkerCAD**. It detects high temperature or gas levels and activates an alarm system with a **buzzer** and **LED indicator**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detects abnormal temperature and gas levels
- Activates buzzer and LED alert system
- Simulated in TinkerCAD (No physical hardware required)
- Great for electronics and Arduino beginners

---

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35)
- Gas Sensor (e.g., MQ-2)
- Buzzer
- LED
- Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The **temperature sensor** and **gas sensor** continuously monitor the environment.
2. When either sensor detects values above a set threshold:
   - The **LED** turns on.
   - The **buzzer** sounds an alarm.
3. The system resets once normal conditions are restored.
