# 🌞 Light Intensity Measurement using LDR Sensor and Arduino (TinkerCAD)

This project demonstrates how to measure light intensity using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) with Arduino, simulated on [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/). It reads analog input from the LDR and displays the brightness level, helping users understand sensor interfacing with Arduino.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- LDR Sensor  
- 10kΩ Resistor  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires

## 🛠️ How It Works
The LDR sensor detects light levels. When light falls on it, the resistance changes, and the Arduino reads this change as analog voltage. You can use `Serial Monitor` to view the real-time light intensity values.

## 💡 Features
- Real-time light level monitoring  
- Simple sensor-based Arduino project  
- Simulated entirely in TinkerCAD (no hardware needed)
