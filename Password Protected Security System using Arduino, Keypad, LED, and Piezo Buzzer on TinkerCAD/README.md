# 🔐 Password Protected Security System | Arduino-TinkerCAD Project

This project demonstrates a simple **Password Protected Security System** using **Arduino**, **Keypad**, **Piezo Buzzer**, and **LED** simulated in **TinkerCAD**. It showcases basic security logic through a user-defined password input and response system.

## 🚀 Features
- Password input via 4x4 Keypad
- LED turns ON when correct password is entered
- Piezo Buzzer alerts on incorrect password
- Easily customizable and beginner-friendly

## 🧰 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- 4x4 Keypad
- LED
- Piezo Buzzer
- Resistors
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. User inputs a 4-digit password via keypad.
2. If the password is correct:
   - LED lights up.
3. If incorrect:
   - Buzzer sounds an alert.
